# A function lambda is a function without a name, that receives a unlimited number of arguments and returns a value. It is used when you need a simple function that will be used only once. It is also called anonymous function. The syntax is:

# function of a potÃªncia:
power = lambda x: x**2
# Function that verifies if a number is even:
pair = lambda x: x % 2==0
